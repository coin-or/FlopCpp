The two makefiles (flopc/Makefile - to build the libraries;
and flopc/Samples/Makefile - to build the samples) assumes that
the flopc directory is a subdirectory of COIN. If this is not the
case the first line of each makefile must be modified to reflect 
the location of COIN.


To build FLOPC++ see INSTALL file.

See http://www.mat.ua.pt/thh/flopc for further information.
